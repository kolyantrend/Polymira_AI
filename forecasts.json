Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf all charges related to providing illegal abortions in this case are dismissed, end due to a plea agreement without an admission of guilt, or if a mistrial is declared for the relevant charges, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf all illegal abortion charges dismissed at any point, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market will resolve according to the initial judgment rendered in this case. Any appeals will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be an official judgement delivered by the ruling court; however, other credible reporting may be used.\n"
